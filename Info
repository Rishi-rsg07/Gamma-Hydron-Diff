to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique.
Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays,taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas,
and developing in the atmosphere. 
Using this model we differentiate and predict which is the Gamma ray and which is Hydron.
