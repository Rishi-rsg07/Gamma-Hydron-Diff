In this project we are using machine learning to differentiate and classify between the Gamma and Hydron particles to tell us weather a given particle is Gamma or Hydron.

To simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique.
Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays,taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas,
and developing in the atmosphere. 

Using this model we differentiate and classify which is the Gamma ray and which is Hydron.
This is my first ever proper hands-on ML project which I have done by myself with the help of FreeCodeCamp.org
We have implied the following models here: 1) kNN 2) Naive Bayes 3) Logistic Regression 4) SVM.
